## About
All in one Restaurants is about managing your store’s inventory and sales in one single connected system. The main idea for this project is for owners of businesses, mainly restaurants, deli shops and similar, to have access to all the information regarding inventory and sales in one software. This way, the owner or manager can see what is going on behind the curtains and have a look at inventory reports, what goes in and out of their business. With easy access to that information, they can make better decisions on what products to purchase for their store’s inventory and when and can also have a more precise knowledge of what is going on, like damage control, missing or disposed products and more.  

What motivated us into developing this software was to get our hands into something that takes us from prototype projects that will never be developed into something that is real and has market potential. We had to learn about new technologies with android development so that we can integrate it with a web-based dashboard, which monitors and delivers the store’s performance and metrics. The cashiers have access to an android app and the management have access to the web interface as well as the mobile app.
